# Hands on Machine Learning 3 - A. Geron 
This repo is a collection of the notes and exercises that I made while sutdying the 3rd edition of the book "Hands on Machine Learing" by A.Geron. It also contains some of ageron's code, avilable at https://github.com/ageron/handsonml3, which includes the code snippets used in the book and the solutions to the exercises.
